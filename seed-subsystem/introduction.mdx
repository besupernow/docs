# Seed Subsystem (UE5)

**Seed Subsystem** provides reproducible randomness via a project-wide seed plus per-call salts. It’s perfect for **procedural generation**, **loot tables**, **AI gates**, and **QA repro**.

## Highlights

- Deterministic by design (global seed + per-call **salt**)
- Fully **Blueprint-accessible** (C++ under the hood)
- **Weighted enum** selection & **constrained lists**
- **Curve** sampling (designer-friendly distributions)
- Editor seed CVAR for stable iteration: `SeedSubsystem.EditorSeed`

## Who is this for?

- UE devs needing **replayable** procgen
- Teams wanting **consistent** bug repro
- Server-auth gameplay that requires synced RNG
